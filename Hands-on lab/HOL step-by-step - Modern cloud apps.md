# Modern cloud apps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will be challenged to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Azure App Services, Microsoft Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Logic Apps, and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, workflows, and monitoring, using various components of Microsoft Azure.

Please note that as opposed to the whiteboard design session, the lab is not focused on maintaining PCI compliance and using more advanced security features such as App Service Environment, Network Security Groups, and Application Gateway. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members working on the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

By the end of this hands-on lab, you will have learned how to use several key services within Azure to improve overall functionality of the original solution, and to increase the security and scalability of the new and improved design.

## Overview

The Cloud Workshop: Modern Cloud Apps lab is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and scale using various components of Microsoft Azure. The lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with additional team members to more closely model a real-world experience, and to allow members to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Exercise 1: Proof of concept deployment

Duration: 60 minutes

Contoso has asked you to create a proof of concept deployment in Microsoft Azure by deploying the web, database, and API applications for the solution as well as validating that the core functionality of the solution works. Ensure all resources use the same resource group previously created for the App Service Environment.

### Task 1: Deploy the e-commerce website, SQL Database, and storage

In this exercise, you will provision a website via the Azure **Web App + SQL** template using the Microsoft Azure Portal. You will then edit the necessary configuration files in the starter project and deploy the e-commerce website.

#### Subtask 1: Configure SQL Database Firewall and Retrieve Connection String

1. Navigate to the Azure Management portal, [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com/), using a new tab or instance and login with your lab-provided Azure credentials.

2. Navigate to the **contososports** resource group.

3. Select the **ContosoSportsDB** SQL Database.

    ![The contososports Resource Group blade with the "ContosoSportsDB" highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image22.png "Azure Portal")

4. On the **SQL Database** blade, select the **Show database connection strings** link.

    ![On the SQL Database blade, in the left pane, Overview is selected. In the right pane, under Essentials, the Connection strings (Show database connection strings) link is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image23.png "SQL Database blade")

5. On the **Database connection strings** blade, select and copy the **ADO.NET** connection string. Then, save it in **Notepad** for use later, being sure to replace the placeholders with your username and password with **demouser** and **demo@pass123**, respectively.

    ![In the Database connection strings blade, the ADO.NET connection string is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image24.png "Database connection strings blade")

6. Go back to the **contososports** resource group blade, and select the **contososports** SQL Server.

    ![The contososports resource group with the contososports sql server highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/2019-11-15-17-47-46.png "Azure Portal")

7. On the **Overview** screen of the **SQL Server** blade, select **Set server firewall** link at the top.

    ![In the SQL Server Blade, Overview section, the Set server firewall tile is in a box.](media/2019-03-31-14-37-31.png "SQL Server Blade, Essentials section")

8. On the **Firewall Settings** blade, specify a new rule named **My IP**, copy your **Client IP address**, and paste it into the **Start IP** and **End IP**. This will set the allowed IP Address range to just your IP address so you can connect to the database from this machine.

    ![Screenshot of the Rule name, Start IP. and End IP fields on the Firewall Settings blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image27.png "Firewall Settings blade")

9. Select **Save**.

10. Update progress can be found by selecting the **Notifications** link located at the top of the page.

    ![Screenshot of the Success dialog box, which says that the server firewall rules have been successfully updated.](media/2019-04-19-13-39-41.png "Success dialog box")

11. Close all configuration blades.

#### Subtask 2: Retrieve Storage Account Access Keys

1. Go back to the **contososports** blade resource group, and select the **contoso** Storage account.

2. On the **Storage account** blade, scroll down, and, under the **SETTINGS** menu area, select the **Access keys** option.

    ![In the Storage account blade, under Settings, Access keys is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image35.png "Storage account blade")

3. On the **Access keys** blade, select the copy button by the **Connection String** field in the **key1** section. Paste the value into **Notepad** for later usage. 

    ![In the Access keys blade default keys section, the copy button for the key1 connection string is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image36.png "Access keys blade, default keys section")

#### Subtask 3: Retrieve Service Bus Queue Connection String

1. Go back to the **contososports** blade resource group, and select the **contoso** Service Bus Namespace.

    ![Service Bus Namespace resource is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-38-09.png "Service Bus Namespace")

2. Select the **Queues** link under Entities.

    ![Queues link under Entities](media/2020-03-18-10-38-57.png "Queues link")

3. On the **Queues** pane, select the **receiptgenerator** Service Bus Queue.

    ![receiptgenerator queue is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-40-40.png "receiptgenerator queue is highlighted")

    >**Note**: The _Publisher_ and _Listener_ shared access policies for the Azure Service Bus Queue were deployed as part of the ARM Template that was used to setup the lab environment. As you can see, the **Publisher** policy that we're copying the connection string for, only has permissions to _Send_ messages to the queue.
    >
    > By default, no policies are created. Additionally, it is best practice to use least privilege security to create separate shared access policies for publishers sending messages and listeners receiving messages from the queue. 

6. On the **SAS Policy** pane, copy the **Primary Connection String**. Paste the value into **Notepad** for later usage. 

    ![Primary Connection String is highlighted](media/2020-03-18-10-54-39.png "Primary Connection String is highlighted")

### Task 6: Modify the Contoso.App.SportsLeague.Web

1. Expand the **Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web** project. Find the **Startup.cs** code file, locate the `public void ConfigureServices(` method declaration, then add the following line of code to the bottom of this method:

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI.AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddAzureADB2C(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureADB2C", options));
    ```

    ![The Startup.cs file with the "app.UseAuthorization();" line of code highlighted.](media/2019-04-19-15-08-40.png "Startup.cs")

2. Add the following `using` directives to the top of the **Startup.cs** code file:

    ```
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI;
    ```

3. Locate the `app.UseAuthorization();` line within the `public void Configure` method, and add the following line of code before it:

    ```
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    ```

    The result will look similar to the following:

   - AzureADB2C:ResetPasswordPolicyId - `B2C_1_SSPR`
   - AzureADB2C:EditProfilePolicyId - `B2C_1_EditProfile`

7. Select **Save**.

### Task 7: Send authentication requests to Azure AD

Your app is now properly configured to communicate with Azure AD B2C by using ASP.NET Core Identity. OWIN has taken care of all of the details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session. All that remains is to initiate each user's flow.

1. Right select the **Controllers** folder, and select **Add** -\> **Controller**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, in the right-click menu for the Controllers folder, Add is selected, and from its menu, Controller is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image177.png "Solution Explorer")

3. Add the following using statement to the top of the controller:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

4. Locate the default controller **Index** method.

    ![The Default controller method Index is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image179.png "Default controller method Index")

    Replace the method with the following code, then **Save** the file:

    ```csharp
    // Controllers\AccountController.cs

    private string _editProfilePolicyId;

    public AccountController(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _editProfilePolicyId = configuration.GetValue<string>("AzureADB2C:EditProfilePolicyId");
    }

    public ActionResult SignIn()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }
            
    public ActionResult SignUp()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult Profile()
    {
        if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
                var properties = new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" };
                properties.Items[AzureADB2CDefaults.PolicyKey] = _editProfilePolicyId;
                return Challenge(
                    properties,
                    AzureADB2CDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
        }
        return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public ActionResult SignOut()
    {
        if (!User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
        string redirectUri = Url.Action("Index", "Home", null, Request.Scheme);
        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties
        {
            RedirectUri = redirectUri
        };
        return SignOut(properties, AzureADB2CDefaults.CookieScheme, AzureADB2CDefaults.OpenIdScheme);
    }
    ```

5. Save the file.

### Task 8: Display user information

When you authenticate users by using OpenID Connect, Azure AD returns an ID token to the app that contains **claims**. These are assertions about the user. You can use claims to personalize your app. You can access user claims in your controllers via the ClaimsPrincipal.Current security principal object.

1. Open the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs** file and add the following using statements at the end of the other using statements at the top of the file:

    ```csharp
    using Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web.Models;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    ```

2. Still in the **Controllers\\HomeController.cs** file, add the following method to the **HomeController** class:

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    public ActionResult Claims()
    {
        var displayName = User.Identity.Name;
        ViewBag.DisplayName = displayName;
        ViewBag.Claims = User.Claims;
        return View();
    }
    ```

3. You can access any claim that your application receives in the same way. A list of all the claims the app receives is available for you on the **Claims** page. In Visual Studio on the Contoso.Apps.SportsLeague.Web object, right-click on **Views -\> Home,** select **Add -\> View**, choose **Razor View - Empty** and name it **Claims.cshtml**.

    ![In Solution Explorer, on the right-click menu for Views\\Home, Add is selected, and from its menu, View is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Moderncloudappsimages/media/image180.png "Solution Explorer")

4. Open the **Claims.cshtml** file and replace the code with the following:

    ```csharp
    @using System.Security.Claims
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = "Claims";
    }
    <h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

    <h4>Claims Present in the Claims Identity: @ViewBag.DisplayName</h4>

    <table class="table-hover claim-table">
        <tr>

### Task 2: Create an Azure Logic App to Process Orders

Without writing any code, you can automate business processes more easily and quickly when you create and run workflows with Azure Logic Apps. Logic Apps provide a way to simplify and implement scalable integrations and workflows in the cloud. It provides a visual designer to model and automate your process as a series of steps known as a workflow. There are [many connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/apis-list) across the cloud and on-premises to quickly integrate across services and protocols.

The advantages of using Logic Apps include the following:

- Saving time by designing complex processes using easy to understand design tools

- Implementing patterns and workflows seamlessly, that would otherwise be difficult to implement in code

- Getting started quickly from templates

- Customizing your logic app with your own custom APIs, code, and actions

- Connect and synchronize disparate systems across on-premises and the cloud

- Build off BizTalk server, API Management, Azure Functions, and Azure Service Bus with first-class integration support

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1. Since the HOL is now complete, go ahead and delete all the Resource Groups that were created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
